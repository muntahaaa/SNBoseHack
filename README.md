# SNBoseHack - Interactive Educational Platform

A modern, interactive educational platform featuring Physics, Mathematics, and Chemistry simulations with AI chatbot assistance, designed to make learning engaging and accessible.

## 🌟 Features

### 🧠 Interactive Subject Simulations
- **Physics**: Interactive simulations on weight-mass relationships and Ohm's law
- **Chemistry**: Litmus test and molarity calculation simulations
- **Mathematics**: Shape identification and number line quizzes

### 🤖 AI Chatbot Tutor
- Subject-specific AI tutors for Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics
- Natural language processing to answer student questions
- Context-aware responses tailored to educational content

### 🔊 Text-to-Speech Integration
The chatbot includes a "Hear the answer" button that allows users to listen to the AI's response. This feature uses Microsoft Azure's Text-to-Speech API to convert text responses into natural-sounding speech.

#### How It Works:
1. When the chatbot provides a text response, a "Hear the answer" button appears at the bottom of the message
2. Clicking this button sends the response text to the backend
3. The backend uses Azure's TTS API to generate an audio file
4. The audio is streamed back to the frontend and played automatically
5. Once loaded, users can play, pause, and reset the audio as needed

#### Controls:
- **Hear the answer**: Initial button to convert text to speech
- **Play/Pause**: Toggle button to control audio playback
- **Reset**: Button to clear the current audio and free up resources
